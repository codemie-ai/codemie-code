## Why CodeMie CLI?

CodeMie CLI is the all-in-one AI coding assistant for developers.

- ✨ **One CLI, Multiple AI Agents** - Switch between Claude Code, Gemini, OpenCode, and custom agents.
- 🔄 **Multi-Provider Support** - OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, LiteLLM, Ollama, and Enterprise SSO.
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform** - Full support for Windows, Linux, and macOS with platform-specific optimizations.
- 🔐 **Enterprise Ready** - SSO authentication, audit logging, and role-based access.
- ⚡ **Productivity Boost** - Code review, refactoring, test generation, and bug fixing.
- 🎯 **Profile Management** - Manage work, personal, and team configurations separately.
- 📊 **Usage Analytics** - Track and analyze AI usage across all agents with detailed insights.
- 🔧 **CI/CD Workflows** - Automated code review, fixes, and feature implementation.

Perfect for developers seeking a powerful alternative to GitHub Copilot or Cursor.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally for best experience
npm install -g @codemieai/code

# 1. Setup (interactive wizard)
codemie setup

# 2. Check system health
codemie doctor

# 3. Install an external agent (e.g., Claude Code - latest supported version)
codemie install claude --supported

# 4. Use the installed agent
codemie-claude "Review my API code"

# 5. Or use Gemini
codemie-gemini "Explain this function"

# 6. Or use OpenCode
codemie-opencode "Generate unit tests"
```

**Prefer not to install globally?** Use npx with the full package name:

```bash
npx @codemieai/code setup
npx @codemieai/code doctor
npx @codemieai/code install claude --supported
# Note: Agent shortcuts require global installation
```

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

For the best experience with all features and agent shortcuts:

```bash
npm install -g @codemieai/code
codemie --help
```

### Local/Project Installation

For project-specific usage:

```bash
npm install @codemieai/code

# Use with npx
npx @codemieai/code --help
```

**Note:** Agent shortcuts (`codemie-claude`, `codemie-gemini`, etc.) require global installation.

### From Source

For development, this project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the package manager for faster installation and builds:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie-code.git
cd codemie-code

# Install Bun if not already installed
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install dependencies and build
bun install
bun run build && npm link
```

**Note:** While Bun is used for development, the package is published to npm and can be installed with any package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun).

### Verify Installation

```bash
codemie --help
codemie doctor
```

## Usage

### AI Agents

CodeMie CLI allows you to install and use multiple AI coding agents:

**Available Agents:**
- **Claude Code** (`codemie-claude`) - Anthropic's official CLI with advanced code understanding
- **Claude Code ACP** (`codemie-claude-acp`) - Claude Code for IDE integration via ACP protocol (Zed, JetBrains, Emacs)
- **Gemini CLI** (`codemie-gemini`) - Google's Gemini for coding tasks
- **OpenCode** (`codemie-opencode`) - Open-source AI coding assistant with session analytics

```bash
# Install an agent (latest supported version)
codemie install claude --supported

# Use the agent
codemie-claude "Review my API code"

# Install Gemini
codemie install gemini
codemie-gemini "Implement a REST API"

# Install OpenCode
codemie install opencode
codemie-opencode "Generate unit tests for my service"

# Install Claude Code ACP (for IDE integration)
codemie install claude-acp
# Configure in your IDE (see docs/AGENTS.md for details)
```

#### ACP Agent usage in IDEs and Editors

**Zed** (`~/.config/zed/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "claude": {
      "command": "codemie-claude-acp",
      "args": ["--profile", "work"]
    }
  }
}
```

**IntelliJ IDEA** (`~/.jetbrains/acp.json`):
```json
{
  "default_mcp_settings": {},
  "agent_servers": {
    "Claude Code via CodeMie": {
      "command": "codemie-claude-acp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Emacs** (with acp.el):
```elisp
(setq acp-claude-command "codemie-claude-acp")
(setq acp-claude-args '("--profile" "work"))
```


**Version Management:**

CodeMie manages agent versions to ensure compatibility. For Claude Code:

```bash
# Install latest supported version (recommended)
codemie install claude --supported

# Install specific version
codemie install claude 2.1.22

# Install latest available version
codemie install claude
```

Auto-updates are automatically disabled to maintain version control. CodeMie notifies you when running a different version than supported.

For more detailed information on the available agents, see the [Agents Documentation](docs/AGENTS.md).

### Claude Code Built-in Commands

When using Claude Code (`codemie-claude`), you get access to powerful built-in commands for project documentation:

**Project Documentation:**
```bash
# Generate AI-optimized docs (CLAUDE.md + guides). Can be added optional details after command as well
/codemie:codemie-init

# Generate project-specific subagents. Can be added optional details after command as well
/codemie:codemie-subagents
```

**Memory Management:**
```bash
# Capture important learnings
/memory-add

# Audit and update documentation
/memory-refresh
```

These commands analyze your actual codebase to create tailored documentation and specialized agents. See [Claude Plugin Documentation](src/agents/plugins/claude/plugin/README.md) for details.

### OpenCode Session Metrics

When using OpenCode (`codemie-opencode`), CodeMie automatically extracts and tracks session metrics:

**Manual Metrics Processing:**
```bash
# Process a specific OpenCode session
codemie opencode-metrics --session <session-id>

# Discover and process all recent sessions
codemie opencode-metrics --discover

# Verbose output with details
codemie opencode-metrics --discover --verbose
```

Metrics are automatically extracted at session end and synced to the analytics system. Use `codemie analytics` to view comprehensive usage statistics across all agents.

## Commands

The CodeMie CLI has a rich set of commands for managing agents, configuration, and more.

```bash
codemie setup            # Interactive configuration wizard
codemie list             # List all available agents
codemie install <agent>  # Install an agent
codemie update <agent>   # Update installed agents
codemie self-update      # Update CodeMie CLI itself
codemie profile          # Manage provider profiles
codemie analytics        # View usage analytics (sessions, tokens, costs, tools)
codemie workflow <cmd>   # Manage CI/CD workflows
codemie doctor           # Health check and diagnostics
```

For a full command reference, see the [Commands Documentation](docs/COMMANDS.md).
